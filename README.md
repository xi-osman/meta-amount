# Amount in the metaverse

This project was created to test [AFrame](https://aframe.io/) a web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences. Thought it would be an interesting idea to mix it up with the excitement of the metaverse and Amount.

There are 2 experiences with this project there is a Meta verse and a NFT Gallery. The meta verse should simulate a neighborhood with only one house that allows you to purchase it, After you click on the sign next to the home it will redirect you to VAAS (Verifications as a Service) and that will approve you for the loan you should then get routed back to the meta verse and see the Amount sign rotating near the house. The NFT gallery is a simple gallery where you can view popular NFT's with only one being able to be purchased but VAAS will not approve you so once you get back to the gallery feel free to take screenshots with your camera! (Oculus required!)
